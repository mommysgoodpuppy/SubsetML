(* Unification over a substitution threaded as state (SubsetML has no references).

   Type variables carry a kind (Types.kind) and a level. A variable created while elaborating
   the right side of a `val` at level n has level n + 1; unification lowers levels so that a
   variable's level is the outermost declaration it escapes to. At the end of the declaration,
   variables still above level n are free in no enclosing context and may be generalized. *)
